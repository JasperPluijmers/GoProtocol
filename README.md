# GO! Protcol description

The protocol uses a simple structure of `commands` and `parameters` delimited by a `+` sign and terminated by a new line. Commands are sent over a simple socket connection. Every command has to be sent on a new line. The order of the parameters is strictly defined in the command and it is assumed this order is followed. As such no flags or identifiers need to be provided.

## Flow

The protocol is started when a player opens a socket connection to the server. The first player to connect will have control over the game configuration (e.g. board size, preferred color, number of players). 

The first step is for the player to identify himself to the server and providing a player name. If the game acknowledges the player it will answer and if it is the first player it sends a request for the configuration. The client responds accordingly.

If both players are identified and the configuration is set the server sends out initial game status (e.g. who you are playing, whose turn it is and the current board layout). 

After this the currently active player can send a move to the server which can acknowledge the move and broadcast a new status. This is continued until the game is finished after which the server broadcasts the finished game status and the winner.

## Commands
In the following description commands and parameters will be given in full caps where parameters are preceeded by a `$` sign. Commands have a set String representation which will be provided in a later section.

### Client commands

#### HANDSHAKE
```bash
HANDSHAKE+$PLAYER_NAME
```

Used to identify yourself to the server with your preferred username.
- `$PLAYERNAME:` **String**. Preferred username.

Example: 
```bash
HANDSHAKE+Thiery Baudet
```

#### SET_CONFIG
```bash
SET_CONFIG+$GAME_ID+$PREFERRED_COLOR+$BOARD_SIZE
```

Set the game configuration and the color you'd like to play with.
- `$GAME_ID`: **Int**. Game id provided by the server in the initial handshake.
- `$PREFERRED_COLOR`: **Int**. integer representation of the color you'd like to play with. (0=random, 1=black, 2=white, 3-9=implemented later)

- `$BOARD_SIZE`: **Int**. Preferred board dimensions. Give `n` for an `n * n` board.

Example:
```bash
SET_CONFIG+0+1+10
```

#### MOVE
```bash
MOVE+$GAME_ID+$PLAYER_NAME+$TILE_INDEX
```
Place a stone on a tile. 

- `$GAME_ID`: **int**. Game id provided by the server on the initial handshake.
- `$PLAYER_NAME`: **String**. Username as set in the initial handshake.
- `$TILE_INDEX`: **int**. Tile you want to place your stone on. The index is one dimensional so for an `n * n` board placing a tile on row `i` column `j` the index is `i * n + j`. `-1` for passing.

example: 
```bash
MOVE+1+Thiery Baudet+9
```

#### PASS (DEPRECATED!)
```bash
PASS+$GAME_ID+$PLAYER_NAME
```
Pass your current move.

- `$GAME_ID`: **int**. Game id provided by the server on the initial handshake.
- `$PLAYER_NAME`: **String**. Username as set in the initial handshake.

example:
```bash
PASS+1+Thierry Baudet
```

#### EXIT
```bash
EXIT+$GAME_ID+$PLAYER_NAME
```
Used to exit the game at any moment.

- `$GAME_ID`: int; Game id provided by the server on the initial handshake
- `$PLAYER_NAME`: String; Username as set in the initial handshake.

example:
```bash
EXIT+1+Thiery Baudet
```

### Server messages

#### ACKNOWLEDGE_HANDSHAKE
```bash
ACKNOWLEDGE_HANDSHAKE+$GAME_ID+$IS_LEADER
```
Server acknowledges the player and provides a game_id for the client.
- `$GAME_ID`: **int**. Game id generated by the server;
- `$IS_LEADER`: **Boolean**. Boolean represented as an integer (0=false, 1=true) indicating wether the player is leader and has to provide the game settings.

example:
```bash
ACKNOWLEDGE_HANDSHAKE+1+1
```

#### REQUEST_CONFIG
```bash
REQUEST_CONFIG+$REQUEST_CONFIG_MESSAGE
```
Ask a client to provide configuration. 

- `$REQUEST_CONFIG_MESSAGE$`: **String**. String containing the message to be displayed requesting the config message. 

example:
```bash
REQUEST_CONFIG+Please provide a preferred configuration using the SET_CONFIG+$PREFERRED_COLOR+$BOARD_SIZE
```

#### ACKNOWLEDGE_CONFIG
```bash
ACKNOWLEDGE_CONFIG+$PLAYER_NAME+$COLOR+$SIZE+$GAME_SATE+$OPPONENT
```

Sent to both players after 2 players have connected and identified themselves and the leader has provided the configuration. 

- `$PLAYER_NAME$`: **String**. Username granted to you by the server
- `$COLOR`:**int**. Integer representing the color to you by the server (1=black, 2=white, 3-9=implemented later)
- `$SIZE`: **int**. Board size. `n` for an `n * n` board.
- `$GAME_STATE`: **State**. String representation of the current game state. The format of the State object is explained in the next section.
- `$OPPONENT`: **String**.  

example:
```bash
ACKNOWLEDGE_CONFIG+Thiery Baudet+1+4+PLAYING;2;0000011120001200
```

#### ACKNOWLEDGE_MOVE
```bash
ACKNOWLEDGE_MOVE+$GAME_ID+$MOVE+$GAME_STATE
```

- `$GAME_ID`: **Int** Game id provided by the server in the initial handshake.
- `$MOVE`: **Move** Move object following the format described in the next section. Represents the move that has been acknowledged.  
- `$GAME_STATE`: **State**. Representation of the current game state. The format of the State object is explained in the types section.

example:
```bash
ACKNOWLEDGE_MOVE+1+30;1+PLAYING;2;0000011120001200
```

#### INVALID_MOVE
```bash
INVALID_MOVE+$ERROR_MESSAGE
```
Sent when an invalid move is sent to the server.
- `$ERROR_MESSAGE`: **String**. Error message.

example:
```bash
INVALID_MOVE+Invalid move: Tile not empty.
```

#### UNKNOWN_COMMAND
```bash
UNKNOWN_COMMAND+$MESSAGE
```
Returned when a command is not recognized or invalid. 
- `$MESSAGE`: **String**. Message.

#### UPDATE_STATUS
```bash
UPDATE_STATUS+$GAME_STATE
